# PID Controller with Simulink

### PID Controlled Spring Mass System
> * One way to tune a spring mass system for a desired output is using a PID controller
> * Definition of PID controller from google: A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.
