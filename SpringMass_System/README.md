# Spring Mass System -  With PID Contoller

### PID Controlled Spring Mass System
> * One way to tune a spring mass system for a desired output is using a PID controller
> * Definition of PID controller from google: A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.
> * See the circuit below and if you want to see what is inside, just view images in files above. 
 

### Time Domain Model
> * This model shows the spring mass over time. 
> * Here you can change the dampening and the forcing function to see different reactions. 
> * As you do this you can see overdamped, underdamped, and critical dampening with the correct respective dampening coefficents. 
> * See the circuit below

### S Domain Model 
> * This transfer into the S domain would be equivalent to transfering to the frequency domain in electrical circuits. 
> * See the circuit below
