# Model and Script - Spring Mass System

### Time Domain Model
> * This model shows the spring mass over time. 
> * Here you can change the dampening and the forcing function to see different reactions. 
> * As you do this you can see overdamped, underdamped, and critical dampening with the correct respective dampening coefficents. 
> * See the circuit below

### S Domain Model 
> * This transfer into the S domain would be equivalent to transfering to the frequency domain in electrical circuits. 
> * See the circuit below
