# This project outlines simulinks ability to add three existing signals and display those signals. 

## There are three signals (varying frequencies and amplitudes) added together to form one signal. 
## Then this signal goes through three different gains and gets outputted on onto the Outpus Scope. 
## You can see that there is a block "To Workspace" that will allow the user to use raw signal data over time in the MATLAB workspace.
